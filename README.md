# Udacity_FrontEndDeveloper_Project2

This is my project2 for the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree.
It demonstrates how to dynamically create a navigational menu that shows which section of the page is being viewed by using Javascript and eventListeners to manipulate the DOM and set/remove CSS-Classes.futhermore a "scroll to section" function is implemented for the navigational links rather than using anchor-links.
